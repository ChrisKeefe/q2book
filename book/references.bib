	                    gives the first detailed description of protists and bacteria
				                  living in a range of environments. The colloquial, diaristic
						                style conceals the workings of a startlingly original
								              experimental mind. Later scientists could not match the
									                    resolution and clarity of Leeuwenhoek's microscopes, so his
											                  discoveries were doubted or even dismissed over the following
													                centuries, limiting their direct influence on the history of
															              biology; but work in the twentieth century confirmed
																                    Leeuwenhoek's discovery of bacterial cells, with a resolution of
																		                  less than 1 Âµm. Leeuwenhoek delighted most in the forms,
			                  interactions and behaviour of his little 'animalcules', which
						                inhabited a previously unimagined microcosmos. In these
								              reflections on the scientific reach of Leeuwenhoek's ideas and
									                    observations, I equate his questions with the preoccupations of
											                  our genomic era: what is the nature of Leeuwenhoek's animalcules,
					                where do they come from, how do they relate to each other? Even
								              with the powerful tools of modern biology, the answers are far
									                    from resolved-these questions still challenge our understanding
											                  of microbial evolution. This commentary was written to celebrate

  abstract = "Global deserts occupy one-third of the Earth's surface and
              contribute significantly to organic carbon storage, a process at
              risk in dryland ecosystems that are highly vulnerable to
              climate-driven ecosystem degradation. The forces controlling
              desert ecosystem degradation rates are poorly understood,
              particularly with respect to the relevance of the arid-soil
              microbiome. Here we document correlations between increasing
              aridity and soil bacterial and archaeal microbiome composition
              along arid to hyperarid transects traversing the Atacama Desert,
              Chile. A meta-analysis reveals that Atacama soil microbiomes
              exhibit a gradient in composition, are distinct from a broad
              cross-section of nondesert soils, and yet are similar to three
              deserts from different continents. Community richness and
              diversity were significantly positively correlated with soil
              relative humidity (SoilRH). Phylogenetic composition was strongly
              correlated with SoilRH, temperature, and electrical conductivity.
              The strongest and most significant correlations between SoilRH
              and phylum relative abundance were observed for Acidobacteria,
              Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, and
              Euryarchaeota (Spearman's rank correlation [rs] = >0.81;
              false-discovery rate [q] = $\leq$0.005), characterized by 10- to
              300-fold decreases in the relative abundance of each taxon. In
              addition, network analysis revealed a deterioration in the
              density of significant associations between taxa along the arid
              to hyperarid gradient, a pattern that may compromise the
              resilience of hyperarid communities because they lack properties
              associated with communities that are more integrated. In summary,
              results suggest that arid-soil microbiome stability is sensitive
              to aridity as demonstrated by decreased community connectivity
              associated with the transition from the arid class to the
              hyperarid class and the significant correlations observed between
              soilRH and both diversity and the relative abundances of key
              microbial phyla typically dominant in global soils. IMPORTANCE We
              identify key environmental and geochemical factors that shape the
              arid soil microbiome along aridity and vegetation gradients
              spanning over 300 km of the Atacama Desert, Chile. Decreasing
              average soil relative humidity and increasing temperature explain
              significant reductions in the diversity and connectivity of these
              desert soil microbial communities and lead to significant
              reductions in the abundance of key taxa typically associated with
              fertile soils. This finding is important because it suggests that
              predicted climate change-driven increases in aridity may
              compromise the capacity of the arid-soil microbiome to sustain
              necessary nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration functions as
              well as vegetative cover in desert ecosystems, which comprise
              one-third of the terrestrial biomes on Earth.",
