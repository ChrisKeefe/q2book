	  title    = "The unseen world: reflections on Leeuwenhoek (1677) 'Concerning
		                little animals'",
	    author   = "Lane, Nick",
	      abstract = "Leeuwenhoek's 1677 paper, the famous 'letter on the protozoa',
	                    gives the first detailed description of protists and bacteria
				                  living in a range of environments. The colloquial, diaristic
						                style conceals the workings of a startlingly original
								              experimental mind. Later scientists could not match the
									                    resolution and clarity of Leeuwenhoek's microscopes, so his
											                  discoveries were doubted or even dismissed over the following
													                centuries, limiting their direct influence on the history of
															              biology; but work in the twentieth century confirmed
																                    Leeuwenhoek's discovery of bacterial cells, with a resolution of
																		                  less than 1 Âµm. Leeuwenhoek delighted most in the forms,
			                  interactions and behaviour of his little 'animalcules', which
						                inhabited a previously unimagined microcosmos. In these
								              reflections on the scientific reach of Leeuwenhoek's ideas and
									                    observations, I equate his questions with the preoccupations of
											                  our genomic era: what is the nature of Leeuwenhoek's animalcules,
					                where do they come from, how do they relate to each other? Even
								              with the powerful tools of modern biology, the answers are far
									                    from resolved-these questions still challenge our understanding
											                  of microbial evolution. This commentary was written to celebrate

															              of the Royal Society.",
