# Building a first plugin 

In this chapter you'll build a simple QIIME 2 plugin that contains three actions: one Method, one Visualizer, and one Pipeline. This plugin will also define a new semantic type, a new file format, and a new transformer. After reading this, you'll have the tools you need to create a QIIME 2 plugin and have your QIIME 2 deployment recognize the plugin.
