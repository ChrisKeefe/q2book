If you'd like to see what this code looks like, you Once a function has been imported, you can view the source code for that function. This will be useful as we begin to explore some of the algorithms that are in use throughout these notebooks. You should spend time reading the source code examples in this book until you're sure that you understand what's happening, especially if your goal is to develop bioinformatics software. Reading other people's code is a good way to improve your own.
